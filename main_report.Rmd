# Background

The author of this report (Timothy) reviewed a manuscript for _Applied Cognitive Psychology_, which was ultimately rejected for publication. In that review, I recommended several potential ways of improving the statistical analyses and the interpretations thereof. I signed the review. Some time after the manuscript was rejected, the main author contacted me and asked if I would like to reanalyze the data and implement some of the things I recommended. I said yes.

This is the outcome.
